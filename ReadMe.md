VS JavaScript Home Test

1) Plain JavaScript only (no frameworks/libraries of any kind please: no jQuery, no React, Angular, etc.), 
2) YouTube Data API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started and https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/implementation/search)

Create a simple single page app that has: 
1. A search box 
2. Search results area 

• Users should be able to sort the results by view count and by date (both in descending and ascending order) without making additional requests to the Youtube api.
• Limit the results to 10 items.

Note: your code will be judged based on:
1) readability (this includes comments too) and organization
2) functionality (absence of bugs)

This doesn't have to be a 'polished' final product, but needs to be functional. 
Feel free to use any css libraries or no css libraries at all.
