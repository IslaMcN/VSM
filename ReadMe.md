VS JavaScript Home Test

## To Begin:
Please run this python server on your terminal before using the project:

python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000

This will help you communicate with the Google API. If you have live server on your IDE it will not have functionality. 

Once you have the server up and running please visit: 

http://localhost:8000

You must sign in with a Google account in order to use the search functionality. From what I understood from the code you need to be able to use the gapi client and in order to do that you have to sign in. If there was a future release cycle for this project I would implement a way to not have to have the user sign in.

# Note:
I understand that have a sort functionality was part of the Minimum Viable Product for this project. I, however, failed in figuring out a way of doing so. I tried every algorithm I could find and think of. I even tried to just make another call to the API just to make a first pass. For some reason, I could never make it work. 

If this disqualifies me from going forward with the hiring process, I understand. However, could you please email me and tell me what is wrong with my code and why the sort function isn't working? This is not me being upset or anything, I have just spent so much time on 












1) Plain JavaScript only (no frameworks/libraries of any kind please: no jQuery, no React, Angular, etc.), 
2) YouTube Data API (https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/getting-started and https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/guides/implementation/search)

Create a simple single page app that has: 
1. A search box 
2. Search results area 

• Users should be able to sort the results by view count and by date (both in descending and ascending order) without making additional requests to the Youtube api.
• Limit the results to 10 items.

Note: your code will be judged based on:
1) readability (this includes comments too) and organization
2) functionality (absence of bugs)

This doesn't have to be a 'polished' final product, but needs to be functional. 
Feel free to use any css libraries or no css libraries at all.
